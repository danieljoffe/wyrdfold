# RLS data-access map (#88 / #6)

Which Supabase client each API surface runs on, and **why the service-role
paths are service-role on purpose**. This is the finish line for #88: when a
path below says "intentional", migrating it is not pending work — changing it
needs a design decision, not a cleanup PR.

Two clients exist (`app/dependencies.py`):

| Client | Dependency | RLS |
|---|---|---|
| **User client** — per-request, bound to the caller's JWT | `get_user_supabase` (JWT-only) / `get_supabase_for_caller` (dual-auth: JWT → user client, api-key → service-role) | enforced (`auth.uid()`) |
| **Service-role** — singleton, bypasses RLS | `get_supabase` | bypassed |

## Migrated — runs on the RLS user client

| Surface | Tables | Since |
|---|---|---|
| `experience.py` (all endpoints) | `experience_*`, `conversation` turns, preferences | #88 Phase 1 (#157–#162) |
| `tailor.py` reads + document writes | `uploaded_resumes`, `documents`, `document_versions` | #88 Phase 1 (#163) |
| `status.py` (history read, status write) | `user_jobs`, `status_log` | #88 Phase 2 (#167) |
| `targets.py` prefs surface (axis-weights ×3, notification-thresholds, preferences ×2) | `user_targets` | #88 Phase 2 (#167) |
| `insights.py` (all three) | reads: `user_jobs`, `status_log`, `analyses`, `llm_costs` + shared catalog | #88 Phase 3 |
| `jobs.py` `DELETE /{id}` (per-user archive) | `user_jobs` | #88 Phase 3 |
| `feedback.py` create/remove/list, learning-log read | `job_feedback`, `target_learning_log` | #79 R1 |
| `user_profile.py` (all but account-delete/export) | `user_profiles` | #79 |

## Intentionally service-role — with the reason

| Surface | Why it cannot / must not use the user client |
|---|---|
| **Cost ledger writes** (`llm_costs` in derive/consolidate/turn/probe/chunks) | `llm_costs` deliberately has **no INSERT policy** for `authenticated`: a user able to write cost rows could forge negative costs and bypass budget enforcement. Endpoints thread a separate service-role `cost_supabase` alongside the RLS client (the Phase-1 dual-client pattern). |
| **Shared-catalog writes** (`jobs`, `targets`, `scores`, `reference_jds` — learner endpoints in `feedback.py`, target CRUD/activation in `targets.py`, manual-add, rescore) | The shared catalog has read-only policies and **no write policy by design** — N users share one target/posting, so "the caller's rows" is undefined. Writes go through service-role + Python ownership guards, or SECURITY DEFINER RPCs (`user_apply_score_blend`, vote tally). The open decision on hardening this further is **#6 R2**. |
| **Operator / cron surfaces** (`admin.py`, `poll.py`, `sources.py`, `discovery.py`, rescore/backfill in `jobs.py`) | Api-key callers have no JWT — there is no user to bind. Gated by `verify_api_key` instead. |
| **Account deletion** (`user_profile.py DELETE /account`) | Spans every per-user table **plus** the Supabase auth admin API (deleting the `auth.users` row) — inherently privileged. |
| **Data export** (`user_profile.py GET /export`) | Reads every per-user table + Storage in one pass; kept on service-role while the export is reworked to stream (#29 H-r2-4). Candidate to ride the user client after that rework. |
| **Pre-auth surfaces** (`waitlist.py`, `keys.py` validation) | No JWT exists yet at call time. |
| **Background pipeline** (poller, scheduler, batch, learner internals) | No request context — these run from cron/queue with the service key, charging work to the activating user via explicit `user_id` params. |

## Dual-auth (JWT → RLS, api-key → service-role): deferred, with reason

`jobs.py` list/read surfaces (`GET /jobs`, `/pipeline-counts`, `GET /{id}`) and
`analysis.py` remain on `get_supabase` + `get_current_user_id_optional` even
though a JWT caller *could* be routed through the user client via
`get_supabase_for_caller`:

- The list path calls the `get_target_jobs` **RPC** — routing it through the
  user client needs an EXECUTE grant + in-function scoping audit first.
- It is the hottest path in the app; flipping its client should be validated
  against a live stack, not shipped blind.

If you pick this up: switch the dependency to `get_supabase_for_caller`,
verify the RPC grant, and extend `tests/integration/test_rls_jobs_reads.py`
to run the list through a user JWT.
