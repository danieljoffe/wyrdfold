"""Typed errors for LLM service failures.

The Anthropic SDK (and OpenRouter, which speaks the same shape) raises
``APIStatusError`` subclasses with vendor-specific messages — e.g.
``"Insufficient credits. Add more using https://openrouter.ai/..."``
for a 402, or rate-limit JSON for 429. Letting those bubble untouched
into the FastAPI response leaks operator concerns to end users (and to
Sentry stack traces) and gives no signal to the FE about whether the
failure is retryable.

This module defines a small hierarchy of *intent* — what the failure
means to the application — and a translator that maps SDK exceptions
onto it. Routers don't need to catch anything: a single FastAPI
exception handler (registered in ``app/main.py``) converts these into
JSON responses with a user-safe ``detail`` string and the appropriate
HTTP status, while preserving the original cause for Sentry.
