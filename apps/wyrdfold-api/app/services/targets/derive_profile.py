"""Derive a ScoringProfile from a reference JD via LLM.

Given a job description, the LLM extracts categorized skills with weights,
seniority signals, domain signals, and negative keywords. The extracted
profile is stored per-reference-JD and merged into the target's composite.

Follows the same pattern as app/services/experience/derive.py:
- Static system prompt (cacheable via Anthropic prompt caching)
- JD text is the only variable content
- complete_json() validates output against ScoringProfile

A content-hash cache backed by the ``target_derive_jd_cache`` table
short-circuits repeat calls for the same (prompt_version, model, jd_text)
tuple. Bump PROMPT_VERSION whenever SYSTEM_PROMPT changes — per the
``feedback-llm-cache-prompt-version`` rule, mismatched versions must
miss-then-rewrite, not return stale output.

}

Rules for scoring_profile:
- "core_skills": skills explicitly listed as required. Weight each keyword 2-3.
- "secondary_skills": preferred or implied skills. Weight each keyword 1-2.
- "nice_to_have": bonus skills mentioned in passing. Weight each keyword 1.
- Seniority level: one of "junior", "mid", "senior", "staff", "principal", \
"director".
- Domain signals: industry vertical or business context (e.g., "fintech", \
"b2b-saas", "healthcare").
- Negative keywords: terms that indicate the JD is NOT for this persona \
(e.g., role is too junior, wrong tech stack entirely).
- Use canonical skill names (React not reactjs, TypeScript not TS, Node.js \
not nodejs).
- Only extract what the JD explicitly supports. Do not invent skills.

Rules for search_keywords:
- 5-15 lowercase role title variations derived from the JD's role title.
- Include common synonyms and abbreviations (e.g., "frontend engineer", \
"front-end developer", "ui engineer").
- These are used for substring matching against job titles, so be broad.
- Do NOT include technology names — only role titles.
- Do NOT include seniority prefixes — the system handles seniority separately.

Rules for example_promising_titles:
- 6-10 concrete, properly-cased job titles that match the role this JD \
describes. Include realistic seniority prefixes (Senior, Staff, Principal) \
— these are full titles a hiring page would post.
- Span the range of acceptable seniorities. If this JD is a staff role, \
include senior + staff + principal variants — same career direction.
- Include close-adjacent role variants the user would still pursue.
- These become POSITIVE few-shot anchors for a downstream binary \
classifier that gates which new postings to score deeply.

Rules for example_unpromising_titles:
- 6-10 concrete job titles that look adjacent but are NOT what this JD \
is about. Same seniority, different role function — the hard cases.
- Avoid obvious negatives. Pick close-but-wrong roles that share \
keywords (TypeScript, accessibility, design system, cross-functional) \
but a different ROLE FUNCTION.
- These become NEGATIVE few-shot anchors.
