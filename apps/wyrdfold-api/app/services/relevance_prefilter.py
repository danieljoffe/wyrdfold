"""Ingestion-time relevance pre-filter via Voyage embeddings.

The keyword scorer can't precision-tune past the noise floor — even with
PRs #770/#771/#776 wired in, a senior target like "Director of CX
Operations & Transformation" still saw thousands of incidentally-matched
postings ("Director of GTM Systems", "Director of AI Deployment",
"Executive Communications Manager") sitting in the 5–25 score band.

The fix is structural: gate ingestion on
``cosine(target_label_embedding, job_title_embedding) >= threshold``.
Voyage-3-lite gives us 512-dim semantic vectors for ~$0.001 per poll
cycle; off-topic titles never make it into ``scores`` so the user's
list view stays clean without a UI score-floor needing to do the work.

Fail-open semantics
-------------------
Both ``label_embedding`` and ``title_embedding`` are nullable. When
either side is missing — fresh target with no label embedding yet,
mock-embeddings client returning zeros, Voyage outage — the gate
admits the posting and lets the downstream keyword scorer handle it.
That's the safe direction: under-filtering recreates the old behaviour
the user already accepts; over-filtering would silently drop relevant
postings with no signal that anything was wrong.
