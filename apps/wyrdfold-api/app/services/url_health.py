"""Periodic URL health check + archival for dead job links.

The poller already archives jobs that disappear from a source's listings.
This service catches the orthogonal failure mode: jobs that the source
still lists but whose ``absolute_url`` has rotted (404, persistent 5xx,
redirect to a "no longer available" landing page).

Lifecycle:
  1. The scheduler ticks every ``URL_HEALTH_TICK_HOURS`` (default 24).
  2. ``check_due`` picks the oldest ``URL_HEALTH_BATCH_SIZE`` live jobs
     whose ``last_url_check_at`` is older than the tick threshold (or
     NULL — never checked).
  3. ``_head_request`` HEADs each URL in parallel under a small concurrency
     cap. HEAD is enough for status; we don't read bodies. Redirects are
     followed (final status is what we want).
  4. Result merged back to ``jobs``: ``last_url_check_at = now()``,
     ``url_check_status = <code>``, ``url_check_failure_count`` bumped on
     4xx / network error and reset on 2xx.
  5. ``archive_dead_jobs`` flips jobs whose failure_count >=
     ``URL_HEALTH_FAILURE_THRESHOLD`` to ``status = 'archived'`` and NULLs
     heavy fields (``description_html`` on jobs; ``axis_scores``,
     ``fit_reasoning``, ``score_breakdown``, ``matched_keywords`` on
     scores) to reclaim DB space.

We track existence by keeping the row + identity (id, external_id, title,
company_name, location, salary_text, absolute_url) so the dedupe in the
poller still works and the user can still see archived jobs in history.
Only the heavy display fields are dropped.

Design choices
  - HEAD, not GET — saves bandwidth and avoids triggering analytics on
    the job board. Some boards return 405 on HEAD; we treat 405 as 2xx
    (the URL exists; the method just isn't supported).
  - 5xx is NOT counted as failure (server hiccup, not job-dead).
  - Network errors (DNS, timeout, connection refused) ARE counted as
    failures (with status=0) — repeatedly unreachable jobs are dead.
  - Threshold-based archival (default 3 consecutive) prevents a single
    bad day at the job board from purging good jobs.

Cost: free. No LLM, no Supabase RPC. Just HTTP HEAD requests. With a 50-
job batch every 24h and ~10 concurrent connections, the entire system
stays well under any reasonable rate limit.
