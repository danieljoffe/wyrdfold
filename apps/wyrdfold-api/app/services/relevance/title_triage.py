"""Phase 1: per-target LLM binary title triage.

Replaces the cosine prefilter as the ingestion-time gate. Given a
batch of job titles + a target's label + the target's auto-generated
example title pools (from PR #788), the LLM returns a binary verdict
per title: PROMISING (worth deeper scoring) or UNPROMISING (drop).

Why this beats cosine
- voyage-3-lite cosines cluster all senior corporate roles in
  0.75-0.85 regardless of domain. No threshold reliably separates
  "Frontend Engineer" from "Product Designer" — both score ~0.8 vs
  a Frontend target. See ``plan-llm-scoring-migration.md``.
- An LLM with a few-shot prompt grounded in target-specific examples
  has the discrimination the embedding model lacks. Cheap enough
  (Haiku 4.5 at ~$0.0001/job) that the per-cycle cost is dominated
  by the polling itself.

Output contract
- Bool only. Phase 2 emits the 0-100 score; Phase 1 just gates.
- Bias is asymmetric: false positives in Phase 1 are cheap (Phase 2
  catches them); false negatives are lost forever. The prompt
  explicitly tells the model to lean PROMISING on close calls.

Persistence
- Phase 1 verdict is written to ``scores.promising`` for the
  (job, target) pair. ``True`` = admitted, ``NULL`` = legacy /
  pre-Phase-1 / Phase-1 unavailable (fail-open). ``False`` is not
  persisted because Phase-1-rejected jobs are not ingested under
  this target — no scores row exists for them at all (matches the
  prior cosine-skip semantics).

Batching
- 250 titles per LLM call by default. At Haiku 4.5 input pricing
  (~$1/1M) + ~50 tokens per title input + ~10 tokens per verdict
  output, that's ~$0.015 per batch. Voyage-style internal
  parallelization isn't needed — the model handles 250 inputs
  comfortably within its context window.

Fail-open
- Any LLM/network error returns an empty verdict map. The poller
  reads "no verdict" as "fail-open admit" so a Phase 1 outage
  doesn't stop ingestion — it just removes the precision filter
  for that poll cycle. Symmetric with the cosine prefilter's
  prior contract.

_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are a job-title relevance gate. For each candidate title in the \
batch you receive, decide whether it is plausibly a match for the \
user's target role.

Be GENEROUS on close calls. A downstream grader does deeper analysis on \
everything you mark PROMISING; a false-positive there is cheap. A \
false-negative here is lost forever — the user will never see the \
posting. When uncertain, mark PROMISING.

What "promising" means
- Same career direction as the target. A "Staff Web Engineer" for a \
"Staff Frontend Engineer" target = PROMISING. A "Senior Backend \
Engineer" for a Frontend target = UNPROMISING.
- Same role function. Engineering vs design vs PM vs marketing vs \
sales vs ops are different functions. Tech-keyword overlap (TypeScript, \
accessibility, design system) is NOT enough — the ROLE FUNCTION must \
match.
- Seniority can flex by one rung in either direction. Stricter \
seniority match isn't your job; downstream code handles that.
- Adjacent specializations are fine when they share the target's core \
discipline (e.g., "Full-Stack Engineer" for a Frontend target = \
PROMISING because the core skill set overlaps).

What "unpromising" means
- Different role function. Designer vs engineer. Marketing vs CX. \
Sales vs operations.
- Wildly different domain (e.g., a hospital "Care Coordinator" for a \
tech "Director of CX" target).
- Clearly off-discipline even if the title shares a word ("Director of \
Sales" for a "Director of CX" target).

Also include a confidence score (0-100) per verdict — how certain you \
are about the promising/unpromising call. Use this scale:

- 90-100: bullseye obvious. "Director of CX Operations" for a "Director \
of CX Operations" target (promising 100); "Senior Frontend Engineer" \
for the same target (unpromising 100).
- 70-89: confident. Adjacent specialisation or one-rung-off seniority \
that fits cleanly under the lean-promising rule (or its inverse for \
unpromising).
- 40-69: legitimately ambiguous — could go either way. Use this band \
honestly; downstream tooling will rely on it to deprioritise borderline \
cases when the Phase 2 cap bites.
- 0-39: hedged. You're guessing. Still emit a verdict (the lean-promising \
rule applies here too), but flag your low certainty.

Confidence is the model's certainty in its verdict, NOT a fit score. \
A high-confidence UNPROMISING is just as useful as a high-confidence \
PROMISING — both let downstream tooling skip Phase 2 work.

Return JSON matching this exact schema:

{
  "verdicts": [
    {"id": 1, "promising": true,  "confidence": 95},
    {"id": 2, "promising": false, "confidence": 88},
    {"id": 3, "promising": true,  "confidence": 55}
  ]
}

One verdict per input title, keyed by the input id. Do NOT omit ids — \
if you can't decide, default to PROMISING with confidence < 50. Return \
ONLY the JSON object. No prose, no markdown, no code fences."""
