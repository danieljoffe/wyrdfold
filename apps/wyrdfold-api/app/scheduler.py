"""In-process job scheduler for periodic polling.

Wraps APScheduler's ``AsyncIOScheduler`` so the FastAPI lifespan can
start/stop a single recurring job that calls ``poll_due_sources``.

The scheduler is **off by default** — opt-in via the
``POLL_SCHEDULER_ENABLED`` env var. Tests should leave it disabled so
the lifespan stays deterministic; ops enable it on the production
process. Any external cron driver (pg_cron, GitHub Actions) can call
``POST /poll/due`` instead and reach the same code path.

Single-instance assumption: APScheduler with ``max_instances=1`` and
``coalesce=True`` is safe for a single FastAPI process. If we ever
horizontally scale the API, swap this for an external trigger so we
don't double-poll.
